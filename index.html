          <h2>The Slumyard One: The First Edition</h2>
          <br>
         
          <p>
            On 16 April 2021, COMETBOYS Entertainment made its debut with The Slumyard, held at
Kitcheners Calvary Bar in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. The event’s theme, inspired by the
slums of old South African townships and the 70s/80s style, was conceptualized by Siphiwe
Molotsi. This collaboration between COMETBOYS and !PLAR set the stage for a unique
and immersive experience that would become a hallmark of their events.</p>
<p>
  <br>
 
The Slumyard featured live performances from artists such as S.U.I, Witney., Blnkego,
Colourful.Melancholy, and AURUM, alongside DJ sets by TNDO, Trinsik, Yolophonik,
and DJ Dark Dindy. Though the event attracted just under 200 attendees, its impact was
significant, generating word-of-mouth buzz that would fuel the success of future events.

    <h2>About COMETBOYS</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Early Beginnings (2019 - Early 2020)</h3>
    <br>
    
    <p>COMETBOYS Entertainment’s journey began in early 2019, with a shared vision among three individuals: Snegugu Mnguni, Minentle Ndzala, and Wandile Matshebula. They sought to create a platform that would bring music, art, and culture to life through unique and community-driven events. The idea for COMETBOYS was sparked through their involvement in local creative spaces and their desire to offer something fresh and exciting to Johannesburg’s entertainment scene. </p>
       <br> <p>Before the company was officially established in 2020, COMETBOYS collaborated with Afrimabonavision starting in December 2019. This early partnership helped the team gain experience and refine their approach to event management, laying a strong foundation for what was to come.</p>
      <br>  <p>Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns throughout 2019 and early 2020, COMETBOYS continued to make progress. The pandemic did not hinder their drive or creativity. Instead, they used this time to strategize, plan, and prepare for the return of live events.
        </p>
<br>
<br>
        <h3>The Formation of COMETBOYS (2020)</h3>
        <br>
        <p>By 2020, COMETBOYS Entertainment was officially established, with Snegugu Mnguni taking on the role of event organizer and networker, Minentle Ndzala handling the finances and trend analysis, and Wandile Matshebula joining as director in 2022, bringing his creative vision and deep understanding of the entertainment landscape to the team. </p>
       <br> <p>During this period, the trio was also involved in !PLAR, a creative partnership that consisted of Siphiwe Molotsi and Wandile Matshebula. Together, they worked on several projects, including conceptualizing themes for future COMETBOYS events. However, when !PLAR dissolved, Wandile fully transitioned to his role as director at COMETBOYS, while Siphiwe Molotsi became the creative director of COMETBOYS. </p>
